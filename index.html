                Today I worked a lot on the website. I made the sidebar fill the side of the<br>
                page and I made the main content page move dynamically with the browser size itself.<br>
                It should make things look better on different types of screen and different screen sizes.<br>
                There are a lot of different things I want to do to the sit such as:<br>
                <br>
                - Add a form where people can post comments or chat. I kind of want to make it like a pin board.<br>
                - Make a kinda like bookmark page to remember good websites or resources<br>
                - Make a blog where I can just post update. And then have like "featured" posts show here<br>
                <br>
                I feel like there's more I'll think of as this site is up, but for now that's all I can think of that<br>
                I want to do :)
              </p>
            </td>
            <td>
              <p class="news-entry">

                <br>
                <br>
                So today I didn't do too much that's noticeable. I basically was working on making the site look good for <br>
                mobile as well as desktop. I want to maybe expand the main container but I'm torn on that. Here soon I <br>
                really want to make a bookmark page of some sort. Also a contacts page. I already mentioned the bookmarks, but <br>
                I don't think I mentioned the contacts. I think I'm going to make a todo page today as well. We shall see :)
